# U3.W8-9: OO Basics: Student


# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 2. Pseudocode



# 3. Initial Solution

class Student
  attr_accessor :scores, :first_name

  def initialize(string)   #Use named arguments!
    :first_name
    :scores
    Alex = Student.new("Alex",[100,100,100,0,100])
    end
end


# 4. Refactored Solution






# 1. DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE
# Tests for release 0:

# p students[0].first_name == "Alex"
# p students[0].scores.length == 5
# p students[0].scores[0] == students[0].scores[4]
# p students[0].scores[3] == 0


# # Tests for release 1:

# p students[0].average == 80
# p students[0].letter_grade == 'B'

# # Tests for release 2:

# p linear_search(students, "Alex") == 0
# p linear_search(students, "NOT A STUDENT") == -1
