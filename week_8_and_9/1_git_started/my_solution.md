## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
Brings new files to git's attention (wherein it takes a snapshot)

#### branch
Like a tree, you create a branch of the project. It has all the code up until the part where you branched off (and more if you update it). 

#### checkout
Changes the file you are looking at. You can think of it as moving around through the git history, or moving backwards, forwards or sideways through time. It's like checking a book out at the library.

#### clone
grabs a complete copy of a repository

#### commit
Commits your code and takes a "snapshot" of where the code is at

#### fetch
Checks to see what happening on the remote branch and pulls them onto your local WITHOUT MERGING.

#### log
shows commit logs

#### merge
Merges changes from the branch you are working on back to the master branch. Also, merges your changes with changes made by others.

#### pull
Updates from the internet to your local

#### push
Updates to the internet from your local.

#### reset
Resets your git logs to the specified HEAD state. (undo is a pretty good one too)

#### rm
removes files from the working tree and index (so you can make it look like you're a genius, who never makes mistakes)

#### status
shows the working tree status. (looks like history. you can also modify using -s & --branch, etc.)
